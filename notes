Concerns:
The choice between IDR and loan isn't a one time choice, but repeatedly made throughout the periods
Need to break down by state
Could switch to IDR in a later period based on updated information regarding income
Double check if both payment levels are correct
Update the income if age bins change part way through
Turn the model into a logit? Should we allow gamma to vary based upon population characteristics?

Followups:
Include interest levels from scf data
Degree type?

Questions:
Double check IDR rates
When gamma = 2 find some people suddenly prefer loans to IDRs
Check secondary loans & consolidate
Run with current incomes
Allow incomes to grow by 5% per year
Interpolate incomes over ages
Allow for more gradual income changes wrt ages
Calculate all incomes once and spit into a excel file rather than repeating every time
When do they start paying off their loans?
