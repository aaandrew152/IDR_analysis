Concerns:
The choice between IDR and loan isn't a one time choice, but repeatedly made throughout the periods
Need to break down by state
Could switch to IDR in a later period based on updated information regarding income
Double check if both payment levels are correct
Update the income if age bins change part way through
Turn the model into a logit? Should we allow gamma to vary based upon population characteristics?

Followups:
Include interest levels from scf data
Degree type?
