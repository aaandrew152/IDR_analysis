Concerns:
Need to break down by state, currently unavailable in public SCF data
Could switch to IDR in a later period based on updated information regarding income
How to utilize current income to determine income expectations?

Followups:
Include interest levels from scf data
Degree type?

Questions:
When gamma = 2 find some people suddenly prefer loans to IDRs --> Default method was subsidizing individuals w/ 0 income
Increasing the std dev of the error term leads the estimated cost to increase.
Should we remove those w/ 0 income? Leads to weird results
